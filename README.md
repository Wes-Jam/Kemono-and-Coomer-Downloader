![Home Page](img/home.png)

### Download Post

#### Option 1: Download 1 Post or Several Separate Posts

##### 1.1 Insert links directly

To download specific posts, enter the post links separated by commas. This option is ideal for downloading a few posts. Example:

```sh
https://coomer.su/onlyfans/user/rosiee616/post/1005002977, https://kemono.su/patreon/user/9919437/post/103396563
```

![Posts](img/posts.png)

##### 1.2 Load links from a TXT file

If you have multiple post links to download, simplify the process using a `.txt` file.

###### Step 1: Creating the TXT File

1. Open a text editor of your choice (like Notepad, VS Code, or other).
2. List the post links in the following format:
   - Separate links with **commas**.
   - Example file content:
```sh
https://coomer.su/onlyfans/user/rosiee616/post/1005002977, https://kemono.su/patreon/user/9919437/post/103396563
```
3. Save the file with the `.txt` extension. For example: `posts.txt`.

###### Step 2: Locating the File Path

You can specify the file path to the script in two ways:

1. **Absolute Path**: Locate the file on your system and copy the complete path.
```sh
C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\posts.txt
```

2. **Relative Path**: If the file is in the same folder as the `main.py` script, just enter the file name.
```sh
posts.txt
```

###### Step 3: Running the Script

1. Paste the TXT file path in the console.
2. The script will automatically start downloading and process all links listed in the file.

###### Script Running

![Script Execution](img/1_2.png)

##### 1.3 Return to main menu

Select this option to return to the home menu.

#### Option 2: Download All Posts from a Profile

‚ö†Ô∏è **General Attention**:
In this download mode, the `files.md` file with information such as title, description, embeds, etc., **will not be created**.
If you need this information, use **Option 1**.

##### 2.1: Download All Posts from a Profile

1. Enter a Coomer or Kemono profile link.
2. Press **Enter**.

**Notes**:
- This mode allows downloading all posts from the entered profile.
- **Limitation**: You cannot download more than one profile at a time.

The system will process the link, extract all posts, and perform the download.

![Script Execution](img/2_1.png)

##### 2.2: Download Posts from a Specific Page

1. Enter a Coomer or Kemono profile link.
2. Press **Enter**.
3. Enter the **offset** of the desired page.

**How to calculate the offset**:
- Both on Kemono and Coomer, offsets increase by 50:
  - Page 1: offset = 0
  - Page 2: offset = 50
  - Page 3: offset = 100
  - ...
- To find the offset of the desired page:
  1. Access the profile page.
  2. Click on the desired page and observe the number at the end of the link.
     Example:
```
https://kemono.su/patreon/user/9919437?o=750
```
In this case, the offset is **750**.

The system will process the specified page, extract the posts, and perform the download.

![Script Execution](img/2_2.png)

##### 2.3: Download Posts in a Page Range

1. Enter a Coomer or Kemono profile link.
2. Press **Enter**.
3. Enter the starting page **offset**.
4. Enter the ending page **offset**.

**How to calculate offsets**:
- The offset calculation follows the same logic as **Option 2.2**.
  - Example:
    - Page 1: offset = 0
    - Page 16: offset = 750

All posts between the specified offsets will be extracted and downloaded.

![Script Execution](img/2_3.png)

##### 2.4: Download Posts between Two Specific Posts

1. Enter a Coomer or Kemono profile link.
2. Press **Enter**.
3. Enter the link or ID of the **initial post**.
   - Example link:
```
https://kemono.su/patreon/user/9919437/post/54725686
```
   - Just the ID: `54725686`.
4. Enter the link or ID of the **final post**.

**What happens**:
The system will download all posts between the two specified IDs.

#### Option 4: Exit Program

This option closes the program.

## File Organization

Posts are saved in folders to facilitate organization. The folder structure follows the pattern below:

### Folder Structure

1. **Platform**: A main folder is created for each platform (Kemono or Coomer).
2. **Author**: Within the platform folder, a folder is created for each author in the format **Name-Service-Id**.
3. **Posts**: Within the author's folder, there is a subfolder called `posts` where contents are organized.
   Each post is saved in a subfolder identified by the **post ID**.

### Example Folder Structure
